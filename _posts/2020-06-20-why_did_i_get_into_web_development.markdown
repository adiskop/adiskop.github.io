My name is Adi Skop, I am 26 years old. Born and raised in Israel in the Tel Aviv area. 
When I was in my early 20s I moved to the US to pursue my pre-med Biology degree. During this time my full intention was to become a physician one day. I worked really hard and finally entered my last semester, in which I was obligated to take a coding class called Intro to C programming. I also took an elective Bioinformatics class, in which we focused on coding in Fortran.

Not in a million years I had imagined I would enjoy these two classes as much as I did. 
I remember thinking about changing majors, but obviously, timing wasn't in my favor. 
And so, I graduated with my Biology bachelors and immediatly started applying to Med Schools. 
I got accepted into an abroad program in Hungary and so, before I knew it I started a life there. 
After about a year, I realized I wasn't pationate enough for this career and that it wasn't for me. 

My first thought was programming. 
I started researching countlessly, what would be the best raut for me to reach my goal and learn how to be the best developer I could be and realized I don't need another 4 year plan. I wanted something immersive, a new exciting yet challenging way. 
And that is when I knew a bootcamp is exactly what I needed. 
Once again, researched about different schools and programs until I came accross FlatIron School. 
That's when I knew that this was it. 

I am so excited to start this journey in the School I wanted the most, and can't wait for what the future holds.
