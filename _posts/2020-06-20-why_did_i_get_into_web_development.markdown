My name is Adi Skop, I am 26 years old. Born and raised in Israel in the Tel Aviv area. 
I moved to the US when I was 20, to pursue my pre-med Biology degree. During this time my full intention was to become a physician one day. I worked really hard and finally entered my last semester, in which I was obligated to take a coding class called 'Intro to C programming', as a part of the requirements. I also took an elective 'Bioinformatics' class, in which we focused on coding in Fortran.

Not in a million years I had imagined I would enjoy these two classes as much as I did. 
I remember thinking about changing majors, but obviously, timing was not in my favor. 
And so, I set this passion aside, graduated with a bachlor's in Biological Sciences and immediatly started applying to Med Schools. 
I got accepted into an abroad program in Hungary and so, before I knew it I started a life there. 
After about a year, I realized I wasn't passionate enough for this career and that it wasn't for me for various reasons. 

My first thought was programming. 
I was researching for weeks what would be the best rout for me, that will allow me to reach my goal and learn how to be the best developer I could be. Eventually, I realized I don't need another 4 year plan. I wanted something immersive, a new exciting yet challenging way. 
And that is when I knew a bootcamp is exactly what I needed. 

I researched about different schools and programs until I finally came accross FlatIron School. 
That is when I knew that this was it for me, and exactly what I was looking for the whole time. 

I am so excited to start this journey in the School I wanted the most, and can't wait for what the future holds.
