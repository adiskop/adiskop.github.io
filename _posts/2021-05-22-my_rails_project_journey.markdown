These blogs are becoming easier to write. 
I like sharing my experience with the course, in case it helps someone else. 

My struggles this time were bugs. For the first time it took me several hours to figure out what I did wrong. 
One of the worst bug I had was when working on my Facebook Omniauth. 
It was absolutley a struggle. I think the lesson did not cover everything, which may be a good thing, and so for the first time I had to research hard. I spent days researching it, when eventually it decided to work. 
Finishing this project gave me the most accomplished feeling so far.

Maybe it's because it was the most difficult project so far as well. 
Or maybe because the Rails Model took me the longest to finish. 

I would like to recomment a few links that helped me out: 

Google Omniauth - this one is incredibly detalied:

This video is great as well for more Omniauth details, great examples:

Anyhow, it feels great and I know how close I am getting to Front End, which is honestly super exciting! 

Thanks for reading,
