These blogs are becoming easier to write. 
I like sharing my experience with the course, and maybe it could evenn help future students. 

My struggles this time were constant bugs which took some time to fix. 

For the first time it took me several hours to figure out what I did wrong in a few of them. 

One of the worst bug I had was when working on my Facebook Omniauth. 
It was absolutley a struggle. I think the lesson did not cover everything, which may be a good thing, because it pushed me to study on my own. And so for the first time I had to research hard. I spent a whole day researching it, when eventually it decided to work. 
 On a brighte note, finishing this project gave me the most accomplished feeling so far. Not sure what it is..

Maybe it's because it was the most difficult project so far as well. 
Or maybe the Rails Model took me the longest to finish. Either way, it feels great to finish it and learn from it. 

I would like to recomment a few links that helped me out: 

Google Omniauth - this one is incredibly detalied:

This video is great as well for more Omniauth details, great examples:

A great video explaining scopes:

A few words on scopes: 
In Ruby on Rails, named scopes are similar to class methods
Named scopes takes two arguments; name and lambda {}. 
lambda is a block of code which is executed only when it's called - not when defined. 
Named scopes always return an ActiveRecord::Relation object.

Anyhow, it feels great and I know how close I am getting to Front End, which is super exciting! 

Thanks for reading,
