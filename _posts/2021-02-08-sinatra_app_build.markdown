The first thing I do before every course project is I take an hour to research. 
I started researching Sinatra projects and found a few of them in the LearnInstruct library. 
At first glance it looked relatively simple and straight forward. 
I did not realize how much logic and effort go to each function. 

And i think this is the biggest lesson I gained from this project. 
I started it and enjoyed it immediatly. I love being creating, thinking about a name and ideas for my projects. 
Later of course, I had some issues, whether an error or a disfunction of a route the longest it took me to figure it out was a day. 
I learned how sometimes the best thing I could do is stop working on the project, go for a run, read a book or watch a show was absolute neccessary for me to let some nerves out and see the issue from a different angle. 

Somewhere around mid-way through the project I came accross the worst Tux error, which later led to a shotgun error, and suddenly anything I did was giving me one huge error. 
This was frustrating because I was towards the end of the build and I was so excited to finally get tested on it, when i realized I have no clue what is wrong and how do I fix it. I was scared all the work I have done would go to waste. 

It took me a night of sleep and a few netflix episodes to calm down and realize that tomorrow is a new day - a new beggining and that's exactly how it went. 
I woke up the day after re-energized - ready to tackle this step by step. 

I also participated the day prior in a "How to Google" study group, which stepped up my search game, so I found a better answer for this error - I finally figured out what was wrong, and after this things went smoother. 

I really enjoyed this project and can't wait to see what's next - hopping we get to do more CSS and designing our apps.
