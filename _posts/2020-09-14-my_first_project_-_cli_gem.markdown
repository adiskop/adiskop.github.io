My first project came right after a trip I took, on which I had 3 weeks of traveling through 8 countries in Europe, enjoying the beautiful Alps. 
And let me tell you, I am greatful for it. 

The first project of the course is a challenge. 
I remember the first time I struggled. 
Was sitting there for hours trying to figure out what was I doing wrong. The hours soon turned to days. 
That's when I realize I am gonna have to slow things down, stop rushing it and try to enjoy with playing around, 
researching different gems and projects I saw online, and then go back to my application. 

It was the smartest idea I have had throughout the process. 
I started watching countless hours of old lectures, writing down guides and notes to self. 

Finally, I could feel confident, that I know what am I trying to achieve and build. 

Not everything went smoothly. 
I had to choose a different website *multiple* time, due to issues with scraping, 
had to rename the whole project, change classes and methods, 
Until I finally felt comftorable with my project, and ready to use it and present it proudly. 

Which was a big step for me. 

I cannot wait for the next project, which is something I never thought I would say, looking back on the first few days of the CLI gem journey. 





Best, 

Adi
